# American Sign Language (ASL) Detection using OpenCV

## Overview
This project demonstrates real-time detection of **American Sign Language (ASL)** gestures using **OpenCV**. The goal is to utilize computer vision techniques to recognize and interpret ASL gestures, bridging the communication gap and enhancing accessibility.

## Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Detects ASL gestures in real-time using a webcam.
- **Preprocessing Techniques**: Implements image preprocessing such as grayscale conversion and thresholding for robust detection.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Employs trained models for gesture classification.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular structure for easy integration and expansion.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For computer vision tasks such as image processing and gesture detection.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Trained Model**: Machine learning model trained to classify ASL gestures.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asl-detection-opencv.git
   cd asl-detection-opencv
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure a webcam is connected and properly configured on your system.

## Usage
1. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python asl_detection.py
   ```

2. A window will appear displaying the real-time webcam feed. Perform ASL gestures within the webcam frame to see the recognition results.

3. To quit, close the webcam window or press `q`.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset to include more gestures for a larger vocabulary.
- Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert gestures to text or speech.
- Deploy the solution as a web or mobile application for widespread use.
